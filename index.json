One noteworthy variant of software supply chain attacks is the circumvention of code signing by utilizing stolen signing keys. Binary Transparency (BT) serves as a mechanism to detect and deter such attacks by mandating that every signed binary is stored in a trusted append-only log. We introduce BT-To-The-X (BT²X) which brings BT to OT. To support retrofitting of computationally less capable devices, BT²X introduces well-defined audit levels and assisting infrastructure. Furthermore, it includes a federated gossiping protocol to detect misbehaving logs presenting inconsistent views to different observers. We implemented BT²X on low-power microcontrollers using Rust and evaluated it with regard to size and performance to demonstrate its practical feasibility.","tags":null,"title":"BT²X: Multi-Leveled Binary Transparency to Protect the Software Supply Chain of Operational Technology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Tatschner","Sebastian N.

Equipped with a rich feature set, the X.509 standard is defined by multiple, comprehensive ISO/IEC documents. Due to its internet-wide usage, there are different implementations in multiple programming languages leading to a large and fragmented ecosystem. This work addresses the research question: Are there user-visible and security-related differences between X.509 certificate parsers? Relevant libraries offering APIs for parsing X.509 certificates were investigated and an appropriate test suite was developed. From 34 libraries 6 were chosen for further analysis. The X.509 parsing modules of the chosen libraries were called with 186,576,846 different certificates from a real-world dataset and the observed error codes were investigated. This study reveals an anomaly in wolfSSL's X.509 parsing module and that there are fundamental differences in the ecosystem. While related studies nowadays mostly focus on fuzzing techniques resulting in artificial certificates, this study confirms that available X.509 parsing modules differ largely and yield different results, even for real-world out-in-the-wild certificates.","tags":null,"title":"ParsEval: Evaluation of Parsing Behavior using Real-world Out-in-the-wild X.509 Certificates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian N.

Concurrently, remote access has gained traction, notably accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While some areas of manufacturing have embraced these advancements, safety applications remain localized. This work aims to enable the remote reset of local safety events. To identify necessary requirements, we conducted expert-workshops and analyzed relevant standards and regulations. These requirements serve as the foundation for a comprehensive security and safety concept, built around a secure gateway. It uses secure elements, crypto agility, PQC, and certificates for secure and authentic communication. To show its applicability, we implemented a prototype, which utilizes a gateway, cameras, and light barriers to monitor the danger zone of a robot and thus enable remote reset via public Internet. The real-world limitations we faced, were used to refine our requirements and concept iteratively. Ultimately, we present a secure and safe solution that enables the remote acknowledgment of safety-critical applications.","tags":null,"title":"Gateway to the Danger Zone: Secure and Authentic Remote Reset in Machine Safety","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Giehl","**Michael P.

We present a flexible, inexpensive, and easy to use testbed enabling OT operators to experiment with different security scenarios. Our testbed is purely virtual so that procurement and construction of physical or hybrid test environments is not required.

Implementing them incorrectly can lead to flaws, making a system or a product vulnerable to various attacks. As shown in the present paper, this statement also applies to ransomware.

Based on already existing research, it establishes a categorization framework to match selected ransomware samples by their respective vulnerabilities and assign them to the corresponding error categories. Subsequently, AntiPatterns are derived from the extracted error categories. These AntiPatterns are meant to support the field of software development by helping to detect and correct errors early during the implementation phase of cryptography.","tags":null,"title":"AntiPatterns Regarding the Application of Cryptographic Primitives by the Example of Ransomware","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hannah Wester","**Michael Heinl**","Peter Schneider"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596499200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596499200,"objectID":"dbb81def06378ad9cdbfbb8d511e8773","permalink":"https://heinl.net/publication/scaleit-2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scaleit-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sicherheitsaspekte der Plattform ScaleIT im Kontext von DigitalTWIN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Gölz","**Michael P.
